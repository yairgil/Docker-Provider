## Release History

Note : The agent version(s) below has dates (ciprod<mmddyyyy>), which indicate the agent build dates (not release dates)

### 01/07/2020 -
##### Version microsoft/oms:ciprod01072020 Version mcr.microsoft.com/azuremonitor/containerinsights/ciprod:ciprod01072020
##### Code change log
- Switch between 10255(old) and 10250(new) ports for cadvisor for older and newer versions of kubernetes

##### Customer Impact
- Node cpu, node memory, container cpu and container memory metrics were obtained earlier by querying kubelet readonly port(http://$NODE_IP:10255). Agent now supports getting these metrics from kubelet port(https://$NODE_IP:10250) as well. During the agent startup, it checks for connectivity to kubelet port(https://$NODE_IP:10250), and if it fails the metrics source is defaulted to readonly port(http://$NODE_IP:10255).
