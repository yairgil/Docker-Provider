  # they are defined to run on specific nodes, are not accidentally frozen
  # out of a node due to other pods showing up earlier in scheduling.

  # them to be created for and thus it is possible to have "normal" pods
  # already in line to run on the node before the DeamonSet controller got a
  # chance to build pod for the node and give it to the scheduler)
